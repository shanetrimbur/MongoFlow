# MongoFlow - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

MongoFlow follows a modular, cloud-native architecture to create a scalable, secure MongoDB Atlas deployment:

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Terraform:** Provisions MongoDB Atlas, sets up users, networks, and authentication.
- **CloudFormation:** Deploys AWS resources (Lambdas, API Gateway, S3, IAM roles, CloudFront for UI hosting).
- **Secrets Management:** Uses GitHub Actions secrets for storing credentials securely.

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- **Automates Infrastructure Deployment:** Runs Terraform and CloudFormation on new commits.
- **Security Scanning:** Uses Snyk & Checkov to detect infrastructure and code vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Testing:** Linting, unit tests, and integration tests before deployment.
- **Multi-Environment Support:** Can be extended for staging, production, or multi-cloud setups.

### Application Layers

- **Backend:**
  - **Python Service** (FastAPI): CRUD operations with MongoDB Atlas.
  - **Go Service** (Gin): High-performance microservices interfacing with MongoDB.
  - **API Gateway (AWS):** Connects frontend to backend services.
- **Frontend:**
  - **React** Single-Page Application (SPA) with UI components.
  - **Static Hosting (AWS S3/CloudFront)** for cost-effective global distribution.

### Security & Compliance

- **Static Analysis:** Snyk, Bandit (Python), Gosec (Go) check for security flaws.
- **Infrastructure Scanning:** Checkov ensures Terraform/CloudFormation follow security best practices.
- **Automated Secret Scanning:** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials.
- **Role-Based IAM Policies:** Enforces least-privilege access for AWS resources.
