# MongoFlow: Seamless MongoDB Atlas CI/CD & DevSecOps Pipeline

## üöÄ Overview

**MongoFlow** is a **production-ready, fully automated CI/CD pipeline** that integrates **MongoDB Atlas** with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **DevSecOps best practices**. It enables organizations to deploy **secure, scalable, and efficient cloud-native applications** while minimizing operational overhead and cost.

By combining **Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Python, Go, and JavaScript**, this project automates:

- **MongoDB Atlas provisioning** via Terraform.
- **CI/CD deployments** using GitHub Actions.
- **Backend services in multiple languages** (Python, Go) connected to MongoDB Atlas.
- **A modern front-end application** hosted on AWS.
- **Security automation** through DevSecOps tools (Snyk, Checkov, GitHub security scans).
- **Zero-cost deployment** using free-tier cloud services.
